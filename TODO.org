#+STARTUP: showall hidestars

* Roadmap march:

* implement zobrist hash of moves / board
** target 64bit word
** suitable as key to DataMap or the like
** quickcheck testing
** http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo_11.html#SEC139


* refactoring
** GameState versus Goban and representation still could be improved

** new state / board implementation
*** ephemeral?
*** updateGameState -> updateBoard becomes destructive
**** really test benchmark
**** must be completely isolated and self-contained
*** can use runSTUArray or the like

*** isSaneMove still needs love
*** showboard still needs love


* new glue between uctNew and gobanNew
** propagation of UCT values / rave values

* towards heuristic
** capture count / atari / atari evade
** patterns

* Data.Tree.UCT
** come back for "negamax if done"?



* prior: even game more likely


General:
* ko / superko
** naive implementation done
* scoring
** territory done
* timer could be more sophisticated
* testing
** quickcheck
** hunit
* profile infrastructure
** http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/How_to_profile_a_Haskell_program
* benchmark
** criterion
* better board representation
** immutable array
** abstract implementation


Kurt.Move:
* better move generation logic ;)
** we are trying...
** initial primitive monte carlo player
** need to tune for speed!!!

Data.Goban:
* track ko state

* Data.Goban.UArray

Network.GoTextProtocol2.Server:
* merge commandargparserlist and commandHandlers lists
* implement a way so commandHandlers can be passed in from an inheriting module running startLoop


Network.GoTextProtocol2.Parser:
* handle #-prefix comments and empty lines
* handle preprocessing (as described on: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html)
